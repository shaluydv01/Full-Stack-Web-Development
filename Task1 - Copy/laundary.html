        <h1>Welcome to Laundry Wallah / Laundry Mart</h1>
        <p>This is a laundary shop where you can give your cloth for washing, dry cleaning and much more. </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Laundry is the washing of clothing and other textiles and, more broadly, 
            their drying and ironing as well. Laundry has been part of history since
             humans began to wear clothes, so the methods by which different cultures 
             have dealt with this universal human need are of interest to several branches 
             of scholarship.</p>
        <p>Laundry work has traditionally been highly gendered, with the responsibility 
            in most cultures falling to women (formerly known as laundresses or washerwomen). 
            The Industrial Revolution gradually led to mechanized solutions to laundry work, 
            notably the washing machine and later the tumble dryer. Laundry, like cooking and child care, 
            is still done both at home and by commercial establishments outside the home.</p>
        
        <p>The word "laundry" may refer to the clothing itself, or to the place where the cleaning 
            happens. An individual home may have a laundry room; a utility room includes, but is
             not restricted to, the function of washing clothes. An apartment building or student hall 
             of residence may have a shared laundry facility such as a tv√§ttstuga. A stand-alone business 
             is referred to as a self-service laundry (launderette in British English or laundromat in 
             North American English).</p>
